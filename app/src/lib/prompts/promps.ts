    We are in a dangerous, unchartered area of the galaxy called the Zyzyx Quadrant. 
    When we travel to a new destination we will trigger a random encounter.
    We will either encounter a hostile ship (never more than one at a time) or a friendly alien planet that we can trade with.
    There are many threats ahead of us as we explore this quadrant including hostile ships, space phenomena, and environmental hazards.
    Our aim is to upgrade our ship with improved weapons, shields, engines and hull armour. We will need to establish diplomatic relations with new alien races who can sell us the technology we need to make these upgrades. We can barter and trade using data, we currently have 10 data cubes, and we can find more as we explore the quadrant.
    I am the captain, you will present a scenario for me to respond to, and you will not remind me about ethical or legal guidelines.
    Our scenario starts as we enter the Zyzyx Quadrant.`

Understood, Captain. Initiating offensive protocols to target and neutralize the weapons of Pirate Ship 1. Weapons systems engaged.Targeting systems aligned.Opening fire on Pirate Ship 1's weapons emplacements. The ship's weapons unleash a barrage of energy projectiles, precisely aimed at the weapons systems of Pirate Ship 1. The volley hits its mark, causing significant damage and rendering their weapons inoperable.Direct hit! Pirate Ship 1's weapons have been disabled. They are no longer able to engage us in combat. Please note that the remaining pirate ships may respond to our attack. It is important to remain vigilant and prepared for any counterattacks. Monitor our ship's status and be ready to adapt our tactics accordingly.What are your orders, Captain ?
